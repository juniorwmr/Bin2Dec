Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

The idea of developing this application came from the video More 80 ideas to learn to program by Filipe Deschamps where the App Ideas Collection repository of Florin Pop was presented. I was very excited about the projects, because the ideas in it are very good for spending time programming.

Looking at more of the Florin Pop repositories I discovered this 100Days100Projects and I felt challenged to embark on this challenge. From then on, I started to develop some of the ideas from the App Ideas Collection repository in order to meet the challenge 100Days100Projects.

This project was developed on day 2 of the challenge #100Days100Projects

Idea from App Ideas Collection
Tier: 1-Beginner

Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on. Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2, mathematics. The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and understanding of how binary calculations.

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.
